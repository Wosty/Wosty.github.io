This is my personal website, built primarily using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io). It is still a work in progress and I am continually adding new pages and features. Some of these planned items include:

- A personal About Me page
- A gallery of some pictures I have of my dog, Apollo
